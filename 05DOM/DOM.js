// Document object model is a tree like structure of html 

// we have browser -> window object -> document -> html -> head and body

// everything in js can be refered as node like : text-node, body node, head node, element node, etc

// by referring to index.html we observe that : -

/*

Head ->  (meta tag and) ,title -> text-node(My first website)

meta tag has attribute 

Body -> div(it has attribute) -> <h1> and <p>
        -> <h1> (has attribute ''text-white) -> text-node
        -> <p> (has no attribute) -> text-node
